# MyLeagueSim Data

This repository contains data I've collected from https://myleaguesim.net. Each folder contains a different set of data. Files are placed in folders organised by date. File names are in the following format: `[type of data]_[date in the format yyyy-mm-dd]_[UTC time in the format hh-mm-ss]_[patch version]`.

The data is collected using Selenium and Python, and usually runs on a Heroku instance with a scheduler. I use my alternate account, AnarchyHelper, to commit to this repository as I don't want to inflate my main account's number of commits.
