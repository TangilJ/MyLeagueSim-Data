# MyLeagueSim Data

This repository contains data I've collected for https://myleaguesim.net. Each folder contains different set of data. Files are named in the following format: `[type of data]_[date in the format yyyy-mm-dd]_[time in the format hh-mm-ss]_[patch version]`.

The data is collected using Selenium and Python. I use my alternate account, AnarchyHelper, to commit to this repository as I don't want to inflate my main account's number of commits.
